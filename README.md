## R code to track, compare and graph relationship (contact) frequency and compare quality of relationships

I investigated the quality of one particulalr relatiosnhip, using contact frequency as a metric, and the other relationship as control.

The particular question for which I am seeking answer is: are the two relationships qualitatively different? Is one relationship inherently stronger and more resiliant than the other?

To answer these question, I designed an experiment, in which I used the contact frequency embedded in my relationship with one friend as control, and contrast it with the contact frequency embedded in the other relationship. In this experiment, I keep both relationships on an even keel, in that both parties are suposed to take turns contacting each other. For exmaple, if the friend contacts me this time, then next time, it will my turn to initiate the contact. After I initiate the contact, I keep track of the number of days lapsed, if any, until the friend reciprocates. Therefore, if the friend reciprocates in one day, then the number of days prior to a contact is 1. If a friend reciproctes in five days, then the number of days prioir to a contact is 5, etc. Conceptually, the number of days prior to a day can be a unbounded number. 

Using the results obtained from this experiment (on-going), I then calculated the maximum likelihood estimator of the probabiltiy of receiving a contact in a given day for both relationships.
